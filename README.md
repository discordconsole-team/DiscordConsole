The console that allows you to control both your user and bot account in interesting ways.

## Special features
Set playing status, simulate typing, bulk delete and more.

### Bulk delete
Yes, you can indeed BULK DELETE messages.  
This allows you to delete a bunch of messages at once,  
without even needing a bot to do it!

### Log
Log the last 100 messages to a file, or just view the last 10 in console directly!

## Command line
We have full command line support.  
Not only pre-supplying a bot token or email and password,  
but you can also send commands and embed it in complex scripts.  

Have it auto start with specific server selected?  
Make a cron job script to automatically tweet how many days it is until Trump leaves? Easy!  

## Cross platform
This project is and will always support Mac, Linux and Windows 64-bits.


# Have fun!
That is the most important of all.
