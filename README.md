To get started, simply [download the console from releases](https://github.com/discordconsole-team/DiscordConsole/releases).

Or compile it yourself: `go get github.com/discordconsole-team/DiscordConsole`, you'll also need the DiscordGo development version; to get that type `make dgo`. Finally, just type `go install`

### Usage

It is recommended to run DiscordConsole in a terminal. To do that, just `cd` to the folder you extracted it and run it by typing `DiscordConsole`. There are a few launch options. You can display them by running DiscordConsole with `-h`.

When starting the DiscordConsole in Windows for the first time, you might get a screen saying that Windows SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting. Just click **More Info** and then **Run anyway**.

Once started, you'll get asked to fill in your token.
If it's a bot token, just type `<token>` in the terminal.
If it's a user token, enter `user <token>`.
If it's a webhook, enter `webhook <link>.`

Then, just press enter! You'll get the following screen:
