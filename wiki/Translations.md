# Translating DiscordConsole

DiscordConsole now supports translating!  
Basically just create a file with stuff like this:  

```
thing=Sak
```

...  
Well you gotta know what things to put in there.  
Don't worry, see the English file in `languages.go`!

One thing! **Any** key can end with `.dev` to only activate if you have the development version!  
Example:

```
update.available=Update available! Version
update.available.dev=Latest stable release:
```
